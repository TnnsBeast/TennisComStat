## What’s inside

- **Embedding neural net** that learns player-specific tendencies and context interactions without massive one-hot vectors.
- **LOFO by skill bucket** to see which areas (serve, return, serve+1, rally control, pressure) drive point outcomes.
- **Counterfactual uplift** per player to rank the single best skill to train for the biggest point-win lift.
- **Author highlights**: top recommendation for Neil Chulani, Charlie Coleman, and Drew Goldman.
